This app is very much a work in progress. I've never used Java FX before, so I'm using this as a tutorial until I'm experienced enough to start actually working on the application.

My goal is to create a cross-platform app that can be used by me(and anyone else) for studying. I am hoping to make it possible to easily add and remove flashcards in different caegories, so I'm thinking I'll need to link to a database at some point. If you have any suggestions, then please feel free to email me.
